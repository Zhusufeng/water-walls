# water-walls
A series of wall heights are represented by integers. Determine which two walls have the most water trapped between them, and exactly how much water that is.
Given heights of [5, 3, 7, 2, 6, 4, 5, 9, 1, 2], your function outputs [3, 8, 11]. I.e., between wall #3 and wall #8, there are 11 blocks of water.
